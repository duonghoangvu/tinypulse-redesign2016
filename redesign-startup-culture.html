          <h2 class="title">THE METHOD</h2>
          <div class="content">
            <p>We surveyed hundreds of founders/CEO's, and compared revenue and employee growth rates with employee sentiment data we collected over the last four years from millions of employees and thousands of companies.</p>
            <p>Our key finding is that there is a strong correlation between workplace culture and revenue growth. However culture gets harder over time — companies hit a “cultural chasm” in years 3 and 4, right when they are expected to scale.</p>
            <p>Thus, it is more important than ever for leaders to be very intentional about building a scalable culture if they want to hit escape velocity and growth.</p>
            <p>Here are some of the key insights uncovered for leaders to improve their probability of growth and scale.</p>

            <h2 class="title">The Surprising Link Between Start-up Culture, Gender & Growth</h2>
            <p>We often think of product/market fit, technology, funding rounds and investors as the building blocks for startup success. But what about the human factors that can improve a start-up's chance of success?</p>
            <p>We surveyed hundreds of founders/CEOs and compared revenue and employee growth rates with employee sentiment data we collected over the last four years from millions of employees and thousands of companies.</p>
            <p>Our key finding is that there is a strong correlation between workplace culture and revenue growth. High-growth companies are not defined by perks and benefits, but by their level of management transparency, appreciation for employees, and workplace happiness. There were also some interesting differences by gender and number of founders that impact start-up growth rates.</p>

          <h2 class="title">Transparency & Growth are Correlated</h2>
          <div class="content dark-text">
            <p>Of the three cultural KPIs analyzed, transparency showed the highest correlation with year-over-year headcount growth (.38). Top-down decision-making can't compete with employees who are empowered by information: Information is power, and transparency fuels faster and smarter decision-making.</p>
            <p>Surprisingly, our research showed no strong correlation between employees' rating of benefits, their direct supervisor, or even work-life balance with revenue or headcount growth.</p>
            <p>As mentioned before, culture is also not defined by perks and ping-pong tables, but a focus on values. Venture capitalist and author of The Hard Thing About Hard Things Ben Horowitz says that Yoga at work is not culture, it is a perk. Horowitz blogged:</p>
            <p><i>“Yes, yoga may make your company a better place to work for people who like yoga. It may also be a great team-building exercise for people who like yoga. Nonetheless, it is not culture. It will not establish a core value that drives the business and help promote in perpetuity. It is not specific with respect to what your business aims to achieve. Yoga is a perk.”</i></p>

          <h2 class="title">The Power Triangle: Happiness, Transparency & Feeling Valued</h2>
          <div class="content dark-text">
            <p>In previous TINYpulse research we found that employees' ratings of work happiness, feeling valued, and management transparency have the highest correlations with the level of employee commitment (likelihood to stay) and engagement (likelihood to refer).</p>
            <p>The rates of happiness, feeling valued, and transparency show a much stronger correlation compared to work-life balance, benefits, and belief in the company's future.</p>
          </div>

            <p>The rates of happiness, feeling valued, and transparency show a much stronger correlation compared to work-life balance, benefits, and belief in the company's future.</p>
            <p>We call these three culture KPIs the “power triangle” because they also serve to reinforce each other. Transparency and happiness have a .60 correlation, value and transparency a .53, and there is a .60 correlation with value and happiness.</p>

          <div class="content dark-text">
            <p>We also looked for causal relationships in the cultural power triangle. One UK-based firm made a specific effort to improve transparency with a company-wide “Ask Me Anything” town hall, which resulted in employee ratings for happiness, referral, and retention beating the benchmarks due to asking this simple three-word question.</p>
            <p>These cultural KPIs serve as leading indicators to measure enterprise health and growth potential.</p>
            <p>We are not alone in this view. It was recently revealed that <a href="http://qz.com/813671/salesforce-crm-treats-glassdoor-like-yelp-for-billion-dollar-buyout-decisions/" target="_blank">Salesforce uses Glassdoor scores in their acquisition analysis</a>.</p>

          <div class="content dark-text">
            <p>We also looked at the gender and number of founders to find any indicators of growth. In a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/26/female-founders-on-an-upward-trend-according-to-crunchbase/" target="_blank">TechCrunch study</a> of 14,341 start-ups that received funding from 2009-2014, 15.5% have at least one female founder. Female founders represented 14% of our study and showed higher year-over-year company growth rates. 71% of female founders showed growth rates of 20% or higher compared to 48% of male founders that earned 20% year-over-year revenue growth.</p>
            <p>57% of companies with two or more founders have a growth rate of 20% or higher. Whereas, 45% of companies with a single founder are hitting 20% year-over-year revenue growth. Y Combinator, the successful start-up incubator that hatched Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe, has encouraged the multi-founder start-up.</p>

          <div class="content dark-text">
            <p>Leaders who prioritize culture are able to scale with talent by lowering unplanned attrition and attracting talent to their organization. In her advice to aspiring entrepreneurs, Stitch Fix founder and CEO Katrina Lake said, <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/entrepreneur-stitchfixs-katrina-lake-weighs/" target="_blank">"Your team is crazy important. Quality is worth paying for — it is possible for an “A” player to be 10x more productive than a “B” player."</a></p>
            <p>In our study we discovered that founders/CEOs who rated the importance of culture the highest (a “10”), had a lower unplanned-attrition rate than leaders who rated it lower.</p>
            <p>HubSpot was very intentional about their culture. For their two-year company anniversary meeting, HubSpot CEO Brian Halligan asked cofounder Dharmesh Shah to talk about culture, where he shared this:</p>
