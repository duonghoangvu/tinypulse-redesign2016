              <p>It's not easy for anyone to open up to anonymous feedback, much less the leader of a company or department. But that's exactly what TINYpulse administrators commit to, and that's why we tell leaders to NOT use TINYpulse unless they are committed to change, sharing feedback, and then taking action based on that feedback.</p>
              <p>We are highlighting the top companies who are passionately dedicated to monitoring and improving their company culture. These organizations are also committed to recognition via Cheers for Peers and responding to virtual suggestions. These companies aren't just winning a once-a-year survey. They are dedicated on a continual basis. Bravo!</p>

                'I am always impressed with our company's desire to thrive by working really hard to make Concept a likeable place for everyone. TINYpulse is one of those smart initiatives at Concept that helps us to do a sanity check on happiness factor of people and identify loose ends to tie. TINYpulse is easy to use, fun to interact with and a great tool to let everyone know about things you don't like or concerned with anonymously. On the flip side, TINYpulse helps management to develop a thicker skin, easily see some of the common pains around the company and provide with the opportunity to show people that they care about them by taking solid actions to address these issues. I believe TINYpulse will play a key role in preventing having a disconnect between the management and the employees as we grow as a company. Also, Cheers for Peers will help employees to strengthen their relationship with peers by showing appreciation for others.'

Despite that, it's so easy to get caught up in the day to day business demands that too often, the really good work can go unnoticed. Enter TINYpulse. They've made it simple and speedy to offer "Cheers for Peers". This quick tool both reminds you, and makes it simple, to offer specific positive feedback to anyone in your organization. It's crazy how both giving and receiving these "Cheers" can put a positive spin on a challenging work week. Thanks to TINYpulse for what they do, and to our Executives for embracing it and working to act on suggestions.'

                'It is very important to us that we maintain the culture we've fostered since founding the company in 1999. As we've grown and added offices maintaining that culture gets more challenging. TINYpulse has been a great way to verify that we are living up to the promises that we've made to our employees. The format, using simple, regular surveys works much better for our management team than a lengthy annual survey. We get regular, open, honest feedback from our employees, and the feedback is actionable; we've implemented changes already based on the feedback. I like to think that everyone here feels comfortable voicing their opinion and discussing concerns with management simply by walking into my office and having a conversation. For the most part that is the case. But TINYpulse provides a venue for those people who are not necessarily comfortable with that approach, or due to their location can't simply walk into my office. The Cheers for Peers feature is an added bonus; it is getting used constantly to recognize individual contributors. We have a very open, team oriented culture here.'

                'TINYpulse has been great for our culture. It has facilitated very frank, honest feedback across the company. We now know about any cultural issues, however small, as soon as they arise. This allows us to address them openly and transparently at the next company-wide meeting before they fester. The 'Cheers' feature - through which the team can publically thank, congratulate and praise one another - has led to an even tighter team dynamic where people feel truly appreciated. We've also received many clever ideas through 'Virtual Suggestions' which has led to excellent improvements to our business. Unsurprisingly, the best ideas have come from our people closest to the customer and I think the anonymity of the platform has helped with that. TINYpulse has been the catalyst for a highly-engaged team and a very happy, healthy workplace.'

TINYpulse has been a huge help in identifying the issues that our team members find most important. When I see that a quarter of our team wants healthier snacks or a larger gym area, I know it's worth the investment. As our company continues to grow, TINYpulse also allows us to break out feedback into sub-groups within the company. For example, Engineering might want a quieter workspace, but not Sales.

Through TinyPulse, I keep a "pulse" on that culture and provide my team with a venue to share their concerns, suggestions, and cheer on one another. Each week I get a better grasp on how happy my team is and provide a weekly meeting to discuss opportunities for improvement, share stories of success, and ultimately plan the future of Killer Infographics together. TinyPulse is one of the ways we ensure every employee has a voice. From requesting the next venue for our company lunch to suggesting ways to improve our process, it provides a forum for positive change and shows my team that their input matters'

We take the time out of a busy workweek to reflect, acknowledge, listen and explain. That's one of the most beneficial perks of our TinyPulse meetings. The "Why" is always explained, which totally changes your motivation as an employee. Suddenly you're not being told what to do, you're being asked how we can make it better. And we want to make it better everyday. As a team, we have created an environment that we are proud to call our own, and we know that each of us has made a huge impact in getting us to this point.'

We've been really happy with the result, realising that some people just prefer to give more detailed suggestions/feedback in writing as opposed to face-to-face. It has helped us to ensure everyone has a voice, and the more concerns raised the better.'

Also it gets a lot harder to distinguish between one person with a problem, patterns that reoccur, and ideas that keep coming back for a good reason. I've found TINYpulse to do something that I'd want my ideal self to do, but too often falls between the cracks: constantly asking the team for feedback and improvements. On top of that, it's a really great archive to visit every now and then for inspiration on how to improve our company and culture. The real kicker?

This wasn't a concrete suggestion, as much as a recurring theme in feedback, that I chose to address and then finetune in our FTHM (Friday Town Hall Meeting) where people can put anything on the agenda and we demo stuff to each other.'

But also, and just as important in having a channel where I can give feedback and make suggestions, I can read what my colleagues think. Quite often, there are things I have never thought of, suggestions of colleagues that inspire and make you think. For example, our Do It Live Fridays (choosing mini projects with multidisciplinary teams to deploy before the weekend, usually small fun things, accompanied by a beer or two)! I had no idea how much I missed that start-up atmosphere, until someone mentioned it as a suggestion and we just started doing it again... And I loooove the cheers!'

                  'Wpromote has ALWAYS been about putting its employee first. Since day one, the Mikes have made their employees (aka high school friends) a priority. Now that we've grown exponentially, they've maintained that interest. The lengths they will go to keep us happy is evident in all of the office perks they offered already. With TINYpulse, it's only become more obvious: music in the bathroom, fresh fruit Mondays, a masseuse three times a week, Fine Wine Fridays, monthly department outings, comped meal plans, free Dodger tickets, free yoga classes, office parties, and even more. It's seriously amazing. Also, due to our growth, we are moving into a new office and TINYpulse has been a huge help in gathering feedback from all of the employees about what we would like our new office environment to be like. I firmly believe that TINYpulse has been the most successful and impactful tool for Wpromote to utilize in maintaining a close relationship with its rapidly growing employee base.'

As COO, I divide my responsibilities into two sections: keeping our clients happy and successful and keeping our employees happy and successful. For the latter, TINYpulse is the best tool in the tool chest. I always tell people that my door is open but when you've got 170+ employees, you've got a lot of different personalities and many prefer the anonymity and direct access of TINYpulse. Through TINYpulse, we've addressed small issues like adding fruit wash in the kitchen or starting a K-cup recycling program to larger issues like implementing a company-wide project management system and bringing revenue transparency to all of our employees. Without TINYpulse, I wouldn't know where we had areas to improve and employees might feel like they have to impose in order to get their voices heard. TINYpulse allows us to be a high functioning organization where work gets done efficiently but also where employee happiness never has to take a backseat.'
