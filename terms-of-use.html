            <p><strong>TINYhr – TERMS OF SERVICE</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Last updated: April 4, 2016</strong></p>

            <p>Please read this Terms of Service (the “Terms”) carefully. It governs your relationship with TINYhr Inc. d/b/a TINYpulse and any of its affiliates or d/b/a designations (collectively, “TINYhr”) and sets forth the terms of service under which TINYhr makes the internet website at <a href="www.tinyhr.com">www.tinyhr.com</a> and its sister websites (together, the “Site”), and the services available through the Site or otherwise provided by TINYhr, including TINYpulse, CLIENTpulse, and any related suite of services (the “Services”), to each person or entity (each a “User”) accessing or using the Site or the Services. (A person who responds to a survey may be referred to as a “Respondent,” but may also considered a User under these terms.) <strong>THE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE, UNDER WHICH YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. PLEASE SEE SECTION 12 FOR THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS.</strong></p>

            <p>These Terms, together with any and all other terms, conditions, rules, policies or procedures published on the Site which are specifically cited in this Terms of Service (“Additional Term”), each as updated from time to time by TINYhr, constitute a binding, legal agreement between TINYhr and User (collectively, the “Agreement”). To the extent you and TINYhr execute a separate written statement of work, side letter, or other written instrument (each, a “SOW”) which incorporates by reference this Terms of Service , these Terms shall supplement such SOW and the SOW shall also be a part of this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between a SOW and these Terms, the conflicting provision in the SOW shall supersede the conflicting provision in these Terms.</p>

            <p>By using the Site or the Services (including by responding to emails, surveys, polls or other communications received from other Users of the Site and the Services), each User hereby agrees to be and is bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree with any of the Terms, do not access or otherwise use the Site or the Services or any information contained on the Site.</p>

            <p>TINYhr may make changes to the content and Services offered on the Site at any time. TINYhr can change the Terms at any time (including any Additional Terms), effective on a prospective basis. If TINYhr changes the Terms, TINYhr will post an updated set of Terms on this Site with a notice that the Terms have been changed, and TINYhr may, but is not required to, send registered Users an email notice of the changes. If any modification is unacceptable to you, you must provide written notice to TINYhr of your objection to such changes and terminate this Agreement within seven (7) days of the date of such change, and you shall cease using the Site and the Services. If you fail to provide such notice or continue using the Site and the Services following such changes, you will be conclusively deemed to have accepted the change.</p>

            <p>Each User hereby warrants that if it is a corporation or other legal entity, such User is validly formed and existing under the laws of its jurisdiction and has duly authorized its agent(s) to enter into this Agreement and, if an individual, such User is of the age of majority in his or her place of residence.</p>

            <ul class="terms">
              <li>
                <strong>1. Subscriptions and Payment</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>1.1.</strong> If User purchases a paid subscription to the Services (a “Subscription”), User shall pay all fees, including for any additional Services purchased by User or usage that exceeds the thresholds at the rates posted, as well as any taxes, applicable to such Subscription, as published on the Site at <a href="http://www.tinypulse.com/pricing/">http://www.tinypulse.com/pricing/</a> from time to time. TINYhr may change such fees at any time and in its sole discretion, provided that any such change shall become effective at the end of the then-current term of User’s Subscription. Late fees shall accrue interest at 1.5% per month or the maximum rate allowable by law, whichever is less, and User shall reimburse TINYhr for all collection costs and expenses.</li>
                  <li><strong>1.2. Subscription membership in the Services is on a continuous service basis. This means that, subject to the terms of this Agreement, TINYhr will automatically renew User’s Subscription at the end of its term unless User’s Subscription is canceled using the tool in User’s account page on the Site at any time prior to the end of the then-current Subscription.</strong> User will be charged a renewal rate equal to the rate for the immediately preceding Subscription period, based upon the Subscription program (annual, quarterly, monthly, etc.) that User has chosen, unless TINYhr has notified User of any new rate in advance. A cancellation of a Subscription requested by User through User’s account will become effective on the date that the then-current Subscription period expires.</li>
                  <li><strong>1.3.</strong> If User has elected to pay the fees referred to in Section 1.1 by credit card, User hereby warrants that User is an authorized signatory for such credit card, the credit card information provided by User is correct, and User shall promptly notify TINYhr of any changes to such credit card information. User acknowledges and agrees that if User’s credit card payment cannot be processed for any reason, TINYhr may suspend or cancel User’s Subscription.</li>
                  <li><strong>1.4.</strong> To the extent User has signed a SOW containing payment provisions, the terms of such SOW shall govern.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>2. Registration.</strong>
                If User has registered for an account to use the Services, User hereby warrants that the registration information provided by User is complete and accurate. User shall ensure that such information is kept up to date. Upon registering for an account, each User will select a password and an account designation if applicable. User acknowledges and agrees that User, and not TINYhr, is responsible for User’s account and log-in credentials, and all activities occurring in connection with the use of that account, whether or not User expressly authorizes such activities.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>3. Content</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>3.1.</strong> User acknowledges and agrees that:
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>(a)</strong> User, and not TINYhr, is responsible for all content that User uploads, posts, emails, distributes, communicates, transmits, or otherwise makes available using the Services or that is otherwise made available through the use of User’s account (if User has one) (collectively, the “Content”), whether or not authorized by User.</li>
                      <li><strong>(b)</strong> By using the Site and the Services, User may be exposed to Content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, libelous, vulgar, obscene, offensive, indecent, invasive of another’s privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable.</li>
                      <li><strong>(c)</strong> User is solely responsible for complying with any legal requirements applicable to any Content it submits to the Services. TINYhr makes no representations or warranties that the Services meets any legal requirements regarding any Content that is subject to any state or federal laws (e.g., HIPAA). User acknowledges that to the extent User needs a customized software solution to meet such requirements, TINYhr will charge User its standard rates to develop a customized solution for User, and the foregoing must be evidenced in a SOW.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>3.2.</strong> User further acknowledges and agrees that TINYhr does not control the Content originating from Users, Respondents, or other users of the Site or the Services, and does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, or quality of such Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, TINYhr may review all Content for any reason, and may block, modify, terminate access to, or remove any such Content that TINYhr considers, in its sole discretion, does not comply with any of the requirements of this Agreement (but TINYhr is not obligated to do so).</li>
                  <p>User further acknowledges and agrees that User, and not TINYhr, is responsible for evaluating the accuracy, reliability, completeness, and usefulness of any information obtained through use of the Site or the Services. TINYhr may rank survey Content and/or provide predictive analytics. User at all times retains the obligation to review such information to ensure its accuracy, reliability, and completeness. TINYhr shall have no liability for any errors or omissions nor any conclusions or actions resulting from such rankings or predictive analytics.</p>
                  <li><strong>3.3.</strong> TINYhr reserves the right to purge Content from its databases at any time and from time to time without notice. User acknowledges and agrees that User is solely responsible for backing up any Content uploaded to the Site by User or received by User through the use of the Services. TINYhr shall not be liable for any purging, deletion, or failure to retain any such Content.</li>
                  <li><strong>3.4.</strong> TINYhr may disable User’s account and access to use the Site and/or the Services and TINYhr may recover from User any losses, damages, costs or expenses incurred by TINYhr resulting from or arising out of User’s non-compliance with any provision of this Agreement.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>4. User Content.</strong>

                  <li><strong>(b)</strong> shall not use the Site or the Services to send surveys, polls, or other materials to minors unless User is permitted to do so under all applicable laws, or to harm minors in any way, and shall not send surveys, polls or other materials to minors that would subject TINYhr to the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act;</li>
                  <li><strong>(c)</strong> shall not impersonate any other person or entity, including TINYhr, or a TINYhr official, forum leader, guide or host, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent User’s affiliation with any other person or entity;</li>
                  <li><strong>(d)</strong> shall not interfere with or disrupt the Site or the Services or servers or networks connected to the Site or the Services, or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies, or regulations of networks connected to the Site or the Services;</li>

                  </li>
                </ul> 
                <div class='has-indent'>
                  Without limiting any of the foregoing, to the extent User’s use of the Site or Services results in TINYhr’s transmission of communications to prospective Respondents (whether in the form of email or in other media), User represents and warrants (1) that User has the right to send such messages to the Respondents and that User has an ongoing business relationship with Respondents, (2) that such communications are being sent by TINYhr on behalf of User, and (3) that any communications sent by TINYhr to Respondents will not violate any laws governing the transmission of unsolicited messages, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, or any similar state or local law or rule. TINYhr has a strict “no spam” policy and the Site or Services may not be used to advertise or promote any products or services.

                  <li><strong>(c)</strong> User’s breach of this Agreement, including any of User’s representations and warranties under this Agreement;</li>
