            <p>TINYpulse began in 2012 when serial entrepreneur David Niu sold his belongings, packed up his wife and baby daughter, and bought one-way tickets to New Zealand. He turned the worldwide trip into his Careercation, taking the opportunity to interview entrepreneurs from various industries and companies. Focusing on one thing they all had in common — the challenges of managing and retaining employees — he created TINYpulse to give leaders a pulse on how happy, burnt out, and frustrated their employees are.</p>
            <p>Since then, David has grown the company to reach employees around the globe, with clients ranging from start-ups to enterprises and across all industries. He continues to support employee engagement by speaking to employees, business leaders, and human resources professionals, and has delivered keynote speeches at the Society for Human Resource Management and other trade organizations.</p>
            <p>To happier employees!</p>
