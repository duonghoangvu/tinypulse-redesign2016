          <div class="block-content">
            <p>Does your workplace have adorable dogs running around the office? What about awesome coworkers that communicate through gifs? TINYpulse is growing, and we're growing fast. Which also means we're on the hunt for some talented people to join our team. But we're huge on culture fit. So before you even take a breeze through the open positions below, ask yourself the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>On a scale of 1 to 10, how awesome are you?</li>
              <li>Are you a lifelong learner?</li>
              <li>Do you like working with people who make you laugh?</li>
              <li>Are you ready to learn, develop, and gain new skills?</li>
              <li>Puppies. You just can't get enough of them. (Okay, that's more of a statement.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you answered "yes" to all of those, then take a gander at what roles we're looking to fill. And just a heads up â€” avoid making these dumb mistakes when applying to the jobs. Believe it or not, out of 200 people that applied, only 10 people read the instructions and sent us the requirements. Sigh.</p>
